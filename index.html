        <h2 class="intro">Welcome to my Portfolio</h2>
        
        <p class="text">
            <b> Greetings, everyone!</b><br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My name is Anurag Bhattacharya, and I am a 21-year-old computer science and engineering student currently in my final year at Netaji Subhas Engineering College in Kolkata. I am excited to share with you today my passion for technology, my skills, and my experience.
            
            From a young age, I have been fascinated by computers and how they work. As I grew up, I developed an interest in programming and began learning different programming languages. I am proficient in C, C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, object-oriented programming, and the STL library in C++. I enjoy exploring new technologies and am always eager to learn more.
            
            During my time at college, I have participated in several coding competitions, hackathons, and technical events. These experiences have taught me valuable skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork. I have also worked on several projects, both individually and in teams, where I have gained practical knowledge and designing a <mark><b> <a href="https://github.com/anurag-bitan/compressor_decompressor">Compressor-Decompressor</a> </b></mark> using Java swing , a  <mark><b><a href="https://github.com/anurag-bitan/Student_manegment">Student management system</a> </b></mark> using Java swing and SQL as database and an website for Vlogers named <mark><b> <a href="https://vlogbook.netlify.app/">VlogBook</a> </b></mark>.
            
            I believe that being a good listener and a proactive learner is essential to succeed in any field. I am always open to feedback, suggestions, and criticism, which helps me improve myself. I also believe in being proactive and taking the initiative to solve problems rather than waiting for someone else to do it.
            
            Apart from academics and coding, I enjoy reading books, playing cricket, and spending time with my family and friends. I believe in maintaining a work-life balance and taking breaks from work to rejuvenate oneself.
            
            As I look towards my future, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I am eager to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the tech industry. I hope to continue learning and growing as a professional and as an individual.
            
            <br><br><br>Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio website, and I look forward to connecting with you!
