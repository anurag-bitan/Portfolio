            <span class="speech"> I am delighted to welcome you to my portfolio website. My name is Anurag Bhattacharya, and I am currently in my final year of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Netaji Subhas Engineering College, Kolkata.<br>

                Ever since I was a child, I was curious about computers and how they work. As a result, I decided to pursue Computer Science after my secondary exams. During my college years, I have been fortunate enough to study various programming languages like C, Java, Python, Flutter, and more. However, my proficiency lies in C and C++, which I have used extensively to develop various applications and projects.<br>
                
                Apart from programming languages, I also have a clear understanding of SQL and how to operate databases. I have used MongoDB to a certain extent, but currently, I am interested in becoming a MERN stack developer. As a result, I am currently learning about these technologies to enhance my skills and knowledge.<br>
                
                While my technical skills are essential, I also possess soft skills that are crucial in the workplace. I consider myself a positive person who looks at challenges as opportunities to learn and grow. Additionally, I am an excellent listener and learner, always open to new ideas and perspectives. I have a never give up attitude, which helps me overcome obstacles and achieve my goals.<br>
                
                In conclusion, I believe that my skills and experiences make me a well-rounded individual who can make significant contributions to any organization. I am excited to embark on a new journey in my career and look forward to connecting with you soon.<br>
                
                Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, and I hope you have a great day!
